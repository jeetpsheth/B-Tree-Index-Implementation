This project contains the source code of the entire B+ tree index structure. The insert, update, and Delete Operations have been implemented, taking care of underflow, overflow, and Root restructuring. The Doubly Linked List structure can be used to carry out range-based query execution. This structure can be used with any relational or non-relational database to reduce the number of disk I/O and bring down the time complexity from O(n) to O(logn).
